 Project Documentation

Overview

This project analyzes sales data, generates visualizations, and executes SQL queries to gain insights into product performance, customer spending, and sales trends. It is organized into the following components:

- Dataset**: `saless_data.csv` containing sales information.
- SQL Queries**: Stored in `queries.sql` for database operations.
- Python Script**: `analysis.py` for generating visualizations and data analysis.

Project Files

 1. **Dataset**: `saless_data.csv`

This CSV file contains sales data with the following columns:

| Column        | Description                        |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `product`     | Name of the product                |
| `category`    | Category of the product            |
| `quantity`    | Quantity of items sold             |
| `price`       | Price per unit of the product      |
| `order_date`  | Date the order was placed          |
| `region`      | Region where the order was made    |
| `customer_id` | Unique identifier for the customer |

 2. **SQL Queries**: `queries.sql`

This file contains SQL queries to extract insights from the sales data. Key queries include:

- Total Sales Per Product**:

  ```sql
  SELECT product, SUM(quantity * price) AS total_sales
  FROM saless
  GROUP BY product
  ORDER BY total_sales DESC;
  ```

- Top Customers by Spending:

  ```sql
  SELECT customer_id, SUM(quantity * price) AS total_spending
  FROM saless
  GROUP BY customer_id
  ORDER BY total_spending DESC;
  ```

- Monthly Sales Trends:

  ```sql
  SELECT DATE_FORMAT(order_date, '%Y-%m') AS month, SUM(quantity * price) AS monthly_sales
  FROM saless
  GROUP BY month
  ORDER BY month;
  ```

 3. Python Script**: `analysis.py`

This script connects to the database, executes SQL queries, and generates visualizations. Key functionalities:

- **Bar Chart for Total Sales Per Product**:

  - Displays the total revenue generated by each product.

- **Bar Chart for Top Customers by Spending**:

  - Visualizes the top customers and their spending.

- **Line Graph for Monthly Sales Trends**:

  - Shows how sales have evolved over months.
